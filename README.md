# The York Vectors - Climate and Economics Metrics Challenge

## Loading this project

This project uses [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/collaborating.html) to allow for reproducibility. By loading this project, `renv` will install itself automatically. You should then run `renv::install()` in the console to install the appropriate R packages.

Note: this uses R version 4.2.3. \*I'm unsure whether `renv` can install a new version of R, so please check you have the right one!\*
